# LAYOFF-ANALYSIS
Project Overview:

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of layoffs data using the "Layoffs_Working2" dataset. The dataset includes information on companies, locations, industries, total layoffs, percentage of layoffs, dates, company stages, countries, and funding raised.

Data Cleaning and Wrangling:

Removed duplicate records to ensure data accuracy.
Standardized the date format for consistent analysis.
Handled null and blank values to prevent errors in calculations and visualizations.
Removed unnecessary columns to focus on relevant data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed industry trends: Identified industries most affected by layoffs.
Examined geographical patterns: Analyzed layoffs across different countries and regions.
Investigated temporal trends: Studied changes in layoff rates over time.
Correlated company size and layoffs: Explored the relationship between funding raised and layoff likelihood.
Analyzed company stage and layoffs: Assessed how different stages of company growth impact layoffs.
